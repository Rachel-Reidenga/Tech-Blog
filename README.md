# Tech-Blog

CMS-style blog site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site is deployed to Heroku. The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
